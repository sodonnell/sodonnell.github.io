[Sean's GitHub.io Repository](https://sodonnell.github.io/)

This repo is intended to deploy a static HTML (splash) page that links to some of my github repos.

It's other purpose is to serve as a cheesy HTML/CSS/JavaScript boiler-plate template for web pages that I may develop. 

## HTML, CSS and JavaScript WebUI Development

I no longer consider myself a Front-end developer, as I do far more server-side, back-end API and systems automation development, but I still enjoy playing around with WebUI tools for my own personal projects.

The current boiler plate is based upon:

- CSS
  - Bootstrap
  - UIKit
  - Font Awesome
- JavaScript
  - Vue.js
  - Axios
  - JSON
- HTML5
