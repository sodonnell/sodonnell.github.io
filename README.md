# sodonnell.github.io

My static [GitHub.io](https://sodonnell.github.io/) site.

This repo is intended to deploy a static HTML (splash) page that links to some of my github repos.

It's other purpose is to serve as a cheesy HTML/CSS/JavaScript boiler-plate/template for web pages that I may develop. 

## HTML, CSS and JavaScript WebUI Development

Although I'm not a "Front-end developer" (by any means), I do enjoy experimenting with some front-end tools for my own personal projects.

The current template includes:

- CSS
  - Bootstrap
  - UIKit
  - Font Awesome
- JavaScript
  - Vue.js
  - Axios
  - JSON
- HTML5
